# Churn_analysis_Python
### Summary of the Project
#### Objective: 
The project appears to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company using a dataset named "Customer Churn.csv."
####Key Insights:
The dataset contains preprocessing steps, such as replacing blank values in "TotalCharges" with 0 and converting "SeniorCitizen" values to categorical labels ("yes"/"no").
#### Churn distribution:
26.54% of customers have churned.

Factors affecting churn:

Senior citizens show a higher churn rate.

Customers with shorter tenures (1-2 months) are more likely to churn.

Month-to-month contracts are associated with higher churn compared to longer-term contracts.

Payment methods like "electronic check" correlate with higher churn rates.

Customers using services such as online security, tech support, and DSL internet tend to churn less.
#### Code Snippets:
#### The notebook includes:
Data loading and cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, data type conversions).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations like pie charts, count plots, and group-wise comparisons.

Usage of libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
### Analysis
#### Strengths:
Comprehensive EDA highlights significant churn-related patterns.

Visualizations are used effectively to communicate findings.

Proper handling of data preprocessing steps (e.g., replacing missing values and resolving data inconsistencies).
